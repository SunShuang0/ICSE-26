- 📄 **Six Million (Suspected) Fake Stars on GitHub: A Growing Spiral of Popularity Contests, Spam, and Malware**  
  Authors: Hao He, Haoqin Yang, Philipp Burckhardt, Alexandros Kapravelos, Bogdan Vasilescu, and Christian Kästner<br/>

    <summary><strong>⭐ Abstract</strong></summary>
    GitHub, the de facto platform for open-source software development, provides a set of social-media-like features to signal highquality repositories. Among them, the star count is the most widely used popularity signal, but it is also at risk of being artificially inflated (i.e., faked), decreasing its value as a decision-making signal and posing a security risk to all GitHub users. In this paper, we present a systematic, global, and longitudinal measurement study of fake stars in GitHub. To this end, we build StarScout, a scalable tool able to detect anomalous starring behaviors across all GitHub metadata between 2019 and 2024. Analyzing the data collected using StarScout, we find that: (1) fake-star-related activities have rapidly surged in 2024; (2) the accounts and repositories in fake star campaigns have highly trivial activity patterns; (3) the majority of fake stars are used to promote short-lived phishing malware repositories; the remaining ones are mostly used to promote AI/LLM, blockchain, tool/application, and tutorial/demo repositories; (4) while repositories may have acquired fake stars for growth hacking, fake stars only have a promotion effect in the short term (i.e., less than two months) and become a liability in the long term. Our study has implications for platform moderators, open-source practitioners, and supply chain security researchers.
